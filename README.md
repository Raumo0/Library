# Library

The project I have to do for the NetCracker courses.

The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/Raumo0/Library)
## Getting Started

* For the final assembly of the project, see the block "**before assembly**".
* To work with the source code, see the block "**before develop**".


### Before assembly

* **Comment** out the dependencies in pom.xml (**tomcat-catalina** and **tomcat-juli**)

### Before develop

* For run tests **uncomment** the dependencies in pom.xml  (**tomcat-catalina** and **tomcat-juli**)
